# Plussa Style Edit
A slightly hacky TamperMonkey script to achieve a look on my uni's learning environment that is a bit easier on the eyes. There are still unedited parts of the style and some texts might appear invisible, but the edits pretty much need to be done case-by-case basis so I add edits whenever I encounter something that is an issue.

Another fix (which inspired this little script in the first place) is the "feature" of the website where hiding the side bar doesn't scale the content to 100%. The script fixes this, and you are able to have the study material at 100% width in your browser window!
